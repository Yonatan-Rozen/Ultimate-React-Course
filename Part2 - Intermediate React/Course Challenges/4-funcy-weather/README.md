## Description

This challenge involves creating project similar to [Classy Weather (v2)](../../Course%20Projects/classy-weather/v2) but with the use of modern react syntax:

- components are declared as functions
- states are displayed and updated with hooks: useState, useEffect & other custom hooks
- eventHandler functions are easier to handle (no pun intended)
- no unnecessary boilerplates! [âœ“]
